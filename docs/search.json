    "text": "Simple exercise in simulation\nLet’s imagine we are taking a walk as a group today at this beautiful field site. What is the number of birds (total abundance of ALL species) each of us is going to see on our hike?\n\nSome questions to ask about simulated data\n\nWhat kind of observations are you going to make? Do they have a minimum or maximum value? Are they integers, or are they decimal numbers, or something else?\nWhere do the numbers come from? This could be anything, from simple linear approximations (i.e. the models we’re looking at in this course) to ODEs, mathematical models, GAMs, etc.\nHow many observations will we be making?\n\nOne of the most useful traits of Bayesian models is that they are generative: they can be used to make a simulated dataset. We’ll do that now for our bird example.\nlet’s simulate from a Poisson distribution:\n\nset.seed(525600)\nn_people &lt;- 21\navg_birds_per_person &lt;- runif(1, min = 0, max = 30)\nbird_count &lt;- rpois(n_people, lambda = avg_birds_per_person)\n\nSome things to note in the code above:\nEvery statistical distribution that is in R (which is a lot! almost all! ) has four different functions. If the distribution is called dist, then they are:\n\nrdist = draw random numbers from dist\nqdist = the quantile function – what value gives a certain proportion of the distribution?\npdist = the probability density function – what proportion of the distribution is below a certain value?\nddist the density function = draws the “shape” of a distribution. How probable are specific values?\n\nThe other thing to note is that there are TWO simulation steps here: first, simulating a value of the average (\\(\\lambda\\)) and second, simulating observations. In our model, the Uniform distribution was referred to as the prior, and the Poisson distribution was referred to as a likelihood, but here you can see that they are very nearly the same thing: just statements about what distribution of values might be most consistent with the data.\n\nPlotting the result\nLet’s take a look at our simulated values:\n\nhist(bird_count, col = \"lightblue\", xlim = c(0, 50))\n\n\n\n\nHistogram of simulated counts of birds\n\n\n\n\nThis is pretty great, and represents one possible realization of sampling. However, one sample isn’t enough to tell us about what our \\(\\text{Uniform}(0, 60)\\) prior really means.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXERCISE\n\n\n\nTry to make many different simulations (say, 12 simulations). This represents 12 different repeats of the whole process: draw a value from the uniform prior, THEN draw a value from the poisson. Visualize them any way you want! (the worked example below uses ggplot2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOLUTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\nset.seed(525600)\n\nsimulate_some_birds &lt;- function() {\n  lambda &lt;- runif(1, min = 0, max = 60)\n  tibble(birds_seen = rpois(23, lambda = lambda),\n         lambda = lambda)\n}\n\nbird_simulations &lt;- purrr::map(1:12, function(x) simulate_some_birds()) |&gt; \n  list_rbind(names_to = \"simulation_id\")\n  \n\nbird_simulations |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = birds_seen)) + \n  geom_histogram(bins = 28) + \n  facet_wrap(~simulation_id) + \n  theme_bw() + \n  labs(x = \"Number of birds observed per person\")\n\n\n\n\nTwelve different simulations of a possible bird dataset. Do all of these seem plausible?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis figure shows different simulations of what, according to our prior, might be reasonable datasets for us to study. Do any of them seem implausible to you? If so, try changing the prior. The goal is to make fake datasets that seem plausible, but which still include the possibility of some surprising observations.\nWhen you have a prior that generates observations that cover a range of scientifically reasonable values, then you are ready to move on to fitting real data.\nAnd then translate it into rstanarm.\n\n\n\nThe model formula\nBoth lme4 and rstanarm use the same classic R formula syntax:\nbirds_seen ~ 1\nWe’re using ~ 1 because our model is very simple, requiring only an intercept.\nBecause it is a Poisson distribution, we also specify the response distribution here, via the family argument.\n\n\nrstanarm code for prior simulation\n\n## make the dataset\nbird_simulation &lt;- data.frame(bird_count = bird_count)\n\nbird_model &lt;- stan_glm(bird_count ~ 1, \n                       family = poisson(link = \"identity\"),\n                       data = bird_simulation,\n                       refresh = 0L,\n                       ## PRIOR ONLY\n                       prior_PD = TRUE,\n                       prior_intercept = normal(location = 30, scale = 10)\n)\n\nbird_model\n\nstan_glm\n family:       poisson [identity]\n formula:      bird_count ~ 1\n observations: 21\n predictors:   1\n------\n            Median MAD_SD\n(Intercept) 30.5   10.0  \n\n------\n* For help interpreting the printed output see ?print.stanreg\n* For info on the priors used see ?prior_summary.stanreg\n\nprior_summary(bird_model)\n\nPriors for model 'bird_model' \n------\nIntercept (after predictors centered)\n ~ normal(location = 30, scale = 10)\n------\nSee help('prior_summary.stanreg') for more details\n\n\n\n\nSampling a prior in rstanarm\nSimulating from a prior is so essential that many Bayesian tools allow you to do this directly.\nWhen we run stan_glm, with prior_PD = TRUE, we sample only from the prior. This generates a large number of simulated datasets – the default is 4000! Each time the model samples, it draws a new value for the unobserved average (avg_birds_per_person) and then 22 values for the number of birds seen by each person.\nLet’s pull out just a few of these datasets and visualize them.\nWe’ll use a wonderful package called tidybayes to easily extract posterior draws from the result of rstanarm.\n\nbird_counts_simulated &lt;- tidybayes::add_predicted_draws(\n  bird_simulation, \n  bird_model)\n\nlibrary(tidybayes)\n\nbird_counts_simulated |&gt; \n  ungroup() |&gt; \n  filter(.draw %in% sample(1:4000, replace = FALSE, size = 16)) |&gt;   \n  ggplot(aes(x = .prediction)) + \n  geom_dotplot() + \n  facet_wrap(~.draw)\n\nBin width defaults to 1/30 of the range of the data.

And with good reason: you need to know how much to trust a model before using it to make a scientific claim. Bayes offers a straightforward way to show how well a model is doing: plot model predictions, and compare them to the observed data. This involves using the model as a data generating machine, which we’ll look at next.\n\nPseudocode\nHere is the procedure for generating posterior predictions:\n\nSelect some posterior posterior draws.\nFor each draw, extract all the model parameters\nFor each draw, plug the sampled parameters in to the model. Use all the same predictors, factors, etc as the original model.\nFor each draw, draw a random dataset that is the same size and shape as your original data.\nOverlay the simulated datasets on the observed data.\n\n\n\nPosterior prediction in R\n\n# just get some draws\ndraws_matrix &lt;- posterior::as_draws_matrix(bill_stan)\n\n## set up a matrix. for every posterior sample, \n## (that is, for a value of mu and a value of sigma) \n## draw a whole fake dataset from a normal distribution with that mean and sd. \nnsamples &lt;- 50\nyrep &lt;- matrix(0, \n               ncol = length(penguins_noNAbill$bill_dep), \n               nrow = nsamples)\n\n# pick some random rows\nset.seed(1234)\nchosen_samples &lt;- sample(1:nrow(draws_matrix), \n                         replace = FALSE,\n                         size = nsamples)\n\nsubset_draws &lt;- draws_matrix[chosen_samples,]\n\nfor (r in 1:nsamples){\n yrep[r,] &lt;- rnorm(n = length(penguins_noNAbill$bill_dep), \n                   mean = subset_draws[r, \"(Intercept)\"], \n                   sd = subset_draws[r, \"sigma\"])\n}\n\nbayesplot::ppc_dens_overlay(y = penguins_noNAbill$bill_dep,\n                            yrep = yrep)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the manual approach, which demonstrates the entire process explicitly.

Does it make sense? take control and choose for yourself.\n\n\nIf we fit a model like this without thinking about the location of zero, we get some pretty silly answers:\n\ncoef(lm(bill_dep ~ bill_len, data = penguins))\n\n(Intercept)    bill_len \n20.88546832 -0.08502128 \n\n\nWhen the value of bill length is 0, the average of the response is the intercept:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\mu_i &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\times\\text{Bill length}_i \\\\\n\\mu_i &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\times0 \\\\\n\\mu_i &= \\beta_0 \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nBut, if we take the data as we found it, we’re going to be talking about \\(\\beta_0\\) as the depth of a penguin’s bill when the bill has 0 length! Clearly that isn’t a very meaningful value. From the point of view of setting priors and interpreting coefficients, it helps a lot to set a meaningful 0.\nA very common choice is to subtract the average from your independent variable, so that penguins with an average bill length now have an average of 0:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Bill depth}_i &\\sim \\text{Normal}(\\mu_i, \\sigma) \\\\\n\\mu_i &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\times(\\text{Bill length}_i  - \\overline{\\text{Bill length}})\\\\\n\\beta_0 &\\sim \\text{Normal}(??) \\\\\n\\beta_1 &\\sim \\text{Normal}(??)\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNow \\(\\beta_0\\) means the average bill depth at the average bill length. It becomes easier to think about priors:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Bill depth}_i &\\sim \\text{Normal}(\\mu_i, \\sigma) \\\\\n\\mu_i &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\times(\\text{Bill length}_i  - \\overline{\\text{Bill length}})\\\\\n\\beta_0 &\\sim \\text{Normal}(17,2) \\\\\n\\beta_1 &\\sim \\text{Normal}(0,.5) \\\\\n\\sigma &\\sim \\text{Exponential}(0.5)\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nWhat continuous predictors have you used in your analysis? How would you find a biologically meaningful zero? Think about how you would center time, age, mass, fitness etc."
