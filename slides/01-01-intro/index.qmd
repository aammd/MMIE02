# Course resources -- books I find useful

## Statistical Rethinking

```

A good portion of this course material is based on this book! it is a fabulous guide to self-teaching!

## Bayesian Data Analysis

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="30%", fig.align='center'}

```

Everything is there -- rather technical !

## Bayesian Data Analysis

Excellent pencil-and-paper intro to Bayesian thinking

-   mite data from the `vegan` package
-   Quinn and Keough datasets

# What is a linear model

## Some examples of linear models in Ecology:

-   a randomized block design
-   BACI - pre-treatment variable
-   growth over time
-   factorial designs

## Extensions to other kinds of data

Linear models can be "_generalized_" to deal with many kinds of data types:

* counts
* proportions
* survival times
* and more


## Putting models inside models: Many names for the same idea

Hierarchical models, AKA:

-   Random effect models

-   Mixed models

-   Multilevel models

-   Variance component models

-   Error component models

# Discussion: What models have you used in the past?

## Structure of linear models

$$
\begin{align}
y &\sim \text{Normal}(\bar{y}, \sigma) \\
\bar{y} &= \textbf{X} \beta_1 + b_0 \\
\end{align}
$$

## Frequentist vs Bayes: "Rival" stastical paradigms?

![](../../img/faceoff_faces.png)


## Frequentist approach

-   Maximum likelihood -- finding parameter values that make the data most likely to have happened.

-   Hypothesis testing: if the data are more extreme than we would observe 1/20 times if the null were true, then we assume that the null is NOT true.

## Bayesian approach

Looking for the joint probability of the *parameters* given the data.

$$
[\theta|\text{data}] = \frac{[\text{data}|\theta] \times [\theta]}{[\text{data}]}
$$

> using Bayes Rule does not make you a Bayesian.
> Using probability as a measure of uncertainty makes you a Bayesian

## Math explanation

\$\$ \[a,b,\sigma \| X\] = \frac{[X | a, b, \sigma][a, b, \sigma]}{[X]}

\$\$

-   Hypothesis testing: asking if a parameter is well-separated from 0.

## Discussion

-   before telling you my opinion of linear models, I'd like to have a group discussion about what limitations each of US has experienced with them.

## Linear models strengths

-   Easy to interpret (?)
-   Easy to fit .. most of the time
-   Designed to **match experiments** and test specific hypotheses
-   Decent approximation to natural phenomenon (c.f. Taylor expansions)

## Linear model weaknesses

-   Easy to OVER interpret
-   Doesn't always fit if your data aren't suitable
-   overused and uncritically used
-   Linear models don't establish *causes* on their own
-   Nature has no straight lines
