<!-- Building and plotting a linear model – published data. Introduction to the penguins dataset, building and plotting a model with these data, including a second predictor – simpson’s paradox, comparison of bayesian approach with frequentist. -->


## Illustrative datasets

To illustrate the different models and methods we will discuss in this course, we will rely on a few data sets, which are directly available in different R packages

. . .

-   `mite`, `mite.env` and `mite.xy` available in the `vegan` R package

. . .

-   `penguins` available in the `palmerpenguins` R package

. . .

These datasets are practical because they are manageable in size and will allow you to see how to work out the different example presented in this course.

. . .

Let's look at them in more details...

# Oribatid mite

## Oribatid mite data

Aside from being very interesting, this dataset has been sampled at the *Station biologique des Laurentides*, so \~200 km north-west from here.

. . .

Sampling was carried out in June 1989 on the partially floating vegetation mat surrounding a lake, from the forest border to the free water by Daniel Borcard.

## Oribatid mite data

. . .

Oribatid mites are small (usually ranging in size from 0.2 to 1.4 mm) invertebrates that are part of the **Arachnida** class (so they have 8 legs).

. . .

In the `mite` data, 35 morphospecies were identified and counted across 70 samples.

## Sites coordinates

`mite.xy`

## Vegetation cover

`mite.env`

## Microtopography and shrub cover

`mite.env`

## Substrate density and water content

## Palmer penguins

These data were collected from 2007 to 2009 by Dr. Kristen Gorman with the *Palmer Station Long Term Ecological Research Program*, part of the *US Long Term Ecological Research Network*.
